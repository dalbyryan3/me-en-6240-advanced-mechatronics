\section*{Exercise 2}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]
    See \verb|ex2a\*|.

    \item[b.]
    See \verb|ex2b\*|.
    
    I chose to put struct, defines, and all declarations of functions in the .h header file.
    This is because these are things that are needed before linking.
    I chose to put the definitions of all functions in the .c file.
    I also put all includes in the .c file since none of them are needed for declarations in the .h file.

    \item[c.]
    See \verb|ex2c\*|.

    I chose to break up the struct definition into its own header file called \verb|investment.c| because both the io functions in \verb|io.c| and in \verb|calculate.c| need the struct.
    \verb|main.c| also needs the investment struct so it just includes \verb|investment.h| and it will be able to use it.
    For functions I put all declarations of io functions(\verb|getUserInput()| and \verb|sendOutput|) in \verb|io.h| and \verb|calculateGrowth()| in \verb|calculate.h|.
    The definitions of these functions where then in their corresponding .c file.
    For the constants I made sure to put them in a place where every thing that would need them would have access but anything that didn't wouldn't know about it, for example I put the \verb|MAX_YEARS| in \verb|investment.h|.
    Once again I also put all the includes in the .c file unless they were necessary for the declaration like for the functions in \verb|investment.c| and \verb|io.c|.
