\subsection*{Exercise 27.}
To debug I would look at what the incorrect output was an see if I could quickly tell what the cause was right off the bat solely based on intuition.
Next, I would begin to test the individual units of the program individually in order to see if I can pinpoint the exact place for the error.
This step would involve using known outputs for a given input to each unit and checking to see if each one matches.
If I still can't find the error I would make sure the known input output pair I initially used to know an error was occurring was correct.
Lastly, I would attempt to use a debugger (or print statements) and systematically analyze what the code does line by line.
